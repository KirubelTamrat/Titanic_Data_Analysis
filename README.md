## Exploring Survival on the Titanic with Pandas
- In this project I use the classic Titanic passenger dataset to practice data analysis with Python and the pandas library. The problem space is understanding which kinds of passengers were more likely to survive the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. 
- This topic matters for data analysis because it has clear variables (age, ticket class, fare, sex, family relationships, etc.) and a concrete outcome (survived or not). 
- Stakeholders who could benefit from this type of analysis include historians, safety researchers, and anyone interested in how social and economic factors can affect survival in disasters.
